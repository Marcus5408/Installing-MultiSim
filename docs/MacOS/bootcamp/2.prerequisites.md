# Prerequisites

## 1. Checking Boot Camp Compatibility

Please double-check that your MacBook is compatible with Boot Camp. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Click on the Apple logo in the top left corner of your screen.
2. Select "About This Mac."
3. Look at the "Processor" field. If it says Apple M-whatever, you will need to use a virtual machine to install MultiSim. If it says Intel, you can use Boot Camp.

If you have an Intel-based MacBook, you can proceed to the next section. If you have an Apple Silicon MacBook, you will need to use a virtual machine to install MultiSim. You can find the guide for that [here](apple-silicon).
