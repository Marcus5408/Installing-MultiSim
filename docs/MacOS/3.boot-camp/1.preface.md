# Preface

If you're here, that means you have an Intel-based MacBook. Good news for you, this means you can actually run MultiSim in an actual version of Windows using Boot Camp. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Boot Camp on your MacBook and installing MultiSim. You can skip this section and go straight to the [guide](prerequisites) if you're already familiar with the situation.

:::warning
This guide may not be fully complete due to a lack of an Intel-based MacBook to test the process. If you have an Intel-based MacBook and would like to contribute to this guide, please refer to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Marcus5408/MultiSim-Guide).
