# Installing Prerequisites

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that allows you to install software and apps easily. We will be using Homebrew to install the software required to set up the virtual machine.

## 1. Installing Homebrew

1. Open the `Terminal` app.
    :::tip
    Spotlight Search is a search feature on macOS that allows you to instantly find files, apps, and other items on your Mac.

    This guide involves a lot of different apps, so it's a good idea to get comfortable with using Spotlight Search to quickly open them.
    The shortcut to open Spotlight Search is `Command + Space`.
