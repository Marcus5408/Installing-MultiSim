# Installing MultiSim

With a NI Account, you can now install MultiSim on your virtual machine:

1. Turn on your virtual machine by opening UTM and clicking on the virtual machine you created, then pressing the play button.
2. Log in to your virtual machine.
3. If you decided to install AtlasOS in the previous steps, launch Brave (the browser that comes with AtlasOS) and go to the [download page](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.multisim.html#369660) to download MultiSim. Otherwise, use Microsoft Edge to go to the download page.
4. Log in to your NI account and download the MultiSim installer.
5. Launch the installer and follow the instructions to install MultiSim.
    :::info
    When you get to the `Installing Circuit Design Suite` screen, select `NI Certificates Installer`. This will make installing other NI software easier, which the installer will also install alongside MultiSim.
    :::
    - When prompted to enable the NI Update Service, select `Yes`.
6. Close the activation window that pops up after the installation is complete, then press the `Restart Now` button in the installer.
