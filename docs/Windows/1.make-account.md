# Making an NI Account

One of the requirements to download MultiSim is to have an NI Account. If you already have an NI account, you can skip this section. If you don't have an NI account, follow these steps to create one on your Mac, not in the virtual machine:

1. Go to [this link](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.multisim.html#369660).
2. Press the "Log in to download" button.
3. Click on the "Create Account>" link.
4. Fill in the required information and press "Create Account". For `Role`, select `Student`. Use your own, personal, non-school email address.
5. Check your email for a verification email from NI. Click on the link in the email to verify your account and press `Continue`.
6. Return to your browser and log in to your NI account by returning to the [download page](https://www.ni.com/en-us/support/downloads/software-products/download.multisim.html#369660) and pressing the "Log in to download" button.
